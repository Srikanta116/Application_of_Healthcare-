MedCamp organizes health camps in several cities with low work-life balance. They reach out to working people and ask them to register for these health camps. For those who attend, MedCamp provides them the facility to undergo health checks or increase awareness by visiting various stalls (depending on the format of the camp).  MedCamp has conducted 65 such events over a period of 4 years and they see a high drop off between “Registration” and the Number of people taking tests at the Camps. In the last 4 years, they have stored data of ~110,000 registrations they have done.  One of the huge costs in arranging these camps is the amount of inventory you need to carry. If you carry more than the required inventory, you incur unnecessarily high costs. On the other hand, if you carry less than the required inventory for conducting these medical checks, people end up having bab experience.
